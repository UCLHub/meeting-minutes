# Basic Concepts

**UCL Hub** is an open-source, not-for-profit student assistant and student community application.

## Guiding Principles

1. We wish to make UCL-related information more **accessible** for UCL students.
2. We wish to build a **welcoming and inclusive community** within UCL students.

## Target Audience

### Identity

UCL students

- Currently enrolled students
- Offer holders

### Purpose

UCL students and offer holders might want to *discuss and share information* among themselves:

- Second-hand item trading (place for *information*, does not serve to be a "market")
- Housing (residence)
- Questions and Answers (Q&A)
- Recommended resources and notes
- Career advice or information
- Lost & found
- Course discussion
- Meme sharing
- General (photo, info, opportunity) sharing
- Societies and clubs (society pages, membership cards, events, discussions, push notifications)

We might want to offer *personalised assistance* and offer *federated information*:

- Have easy access to their timetables (personal, course)
- Transition Mentor style advice (especially for offer holder and new students)
- Check library and study space status (number of occupied seats, opening times)
    - We can link to UCL library's booking service (no available API)
- Check empty lecture rooms based on time (e.g. next hour availability, see UCL assistant)
- Restaurants and cafe around the campus (possibly in the vicinity of the campus as well)
- Professor and staff info look up (email address, dept, name)
- Link to commonly used UCL services
- Current COVID-19 situation (guidelines, restrictions, clusters, pandemic severeness, vaccine development status)
- TfL status (tube line status, buses router - maybe in the end)

# Core Functional Requirements (MVP)

Two feature sets:

1. Personalized information and guidance
2. Student Community

But to uphold the community guidelines, we also require an admin management interface so the content posted can be moderated, and user permissions can be managed.

## Personalized Information and Guidance

1. Personal timetable
    1. Daily view
    2. Weekly view
    3. Monthly view
2. Library and study space availability
    1. Absolute number of seats available
    2. Percentage of seats available
    3. Sorting (by name, available seats)
    4. User favourite libraries
3. COVID-19 information
    1. Daily, weekly and monthly change in number of cases (infected, deaths, recovered, suspected/quarantined)
    2. Daily, weekly and monthly change in total number of cases
    3. Nearby cases
    4. Trends by different date intervals
    5. Protection information (UK government issued guidance + Chinese government issued guidance + UCL guidance)
4. Transport for London (TfL) tube status

## Student Community

1. General Forum
    1. Publish posts with text, images and links
        1. Allow comments
    2. Separate multiple locales (initially zh, en)
    3. Post category

    5. Filter by category, sort by publish date
2. Second-handed Market (**not** C2C/B2C, *only* to allow information exchange, we do not handle transactions)
    1. Filter by item type, publish date, price range
3. User profile
    1. Select info to display
    2. User profile information (selective visibility):
        1. First name, middle name and last name (optional)
        2. Programme
        3. Education level
        4. Year of study

    3. Contact details
    4. Verified UCL student status (via UCL API)

## Admin Tools

2. Manage, block, delete users
3. Role-based user permissions management

# Core Non-Functional Requirements
